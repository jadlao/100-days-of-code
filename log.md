# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Advanced Beginner Challenge first React app tutorial. Completed it and pushed code to Github.

**Thoughts**: Figured out how to install dependencies via package.json files using npm scripts, and how it ties in with using other packages to compile JSX code to JS, both for a development and production environment.
